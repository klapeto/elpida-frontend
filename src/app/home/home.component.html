<p>
    Elpida is an Open Source (GPLv3) Benchmarking framework for measuring performance of computer hardware or
    algorithms.
    It's goal is to be as transparent and open as possible as well as exensible by the community. It comes with a
    library (libelpida), a Qt application and a set of predefined benchmarks for measuring computer hardware
    capabilities. </p>
<p>Elpida has the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Variety of pre-defined benchmarks.</b> The Stand alone application comes
        with predefined
        benchmarks for testing hardware, ranging from Memory bandwidth/Latency to PNG encoding and Storage Bandwithdth
        benchmarks.
    </li>
    <li><b>Easy benchmark creation.</b> You only create specifications and
        implementations of the tasks of your benchmark.
        More technical details are handled by default by the framework.
    </li>
    <li><b>Automatic chunk based Multithreading.</b> You create a task for a single
        thread execution. Then if your task can
        be broken into multiple threads to take a chunk of the input, you only have to set up a flag on your task. The
        rest will be handled by the framework. You only need to create your task as it would be executed as a single
        thread.
    </li>
    <li><b>NUMA-Awareness for tasks.</b> You don't have to be aware of
        NUMA when creating your tasks. CPU/Memory pinning
        happens automatically before each task execution. So your task will always have local memory (if possible) and
        will
        be pinned to the nearest CPU to that memory region.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Plugin based benchmark loading.</strong> Benchmarks are defined in plugins
        that are dynamically loaded during
        execution. This means you can add more plugins on the load folder and the application will detect them as new.
        This way the community
        can share plugins to use outside of the official ones.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>CPU capabilities/Topology detection.</b> You want to use specific
        instructions found
        on specific CPUs for your task? No problem. The framework can provide you with information on what the current
        hardware is capable of as well the whole system Topology, thanks to <a
            href="https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/">hwloc</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Affinity based Benchmark runs.</b> The stand alone application allows you
        to run benchmarks on specific CPUs Cores/Threads.
        With the Topology component you can select from the whole Machine (multiple packages) down to specific EU
        (Thread).
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Anonymous result postings.</b> After each benchmark, the results are
        posted anonymously on
        the official Elpida site. Data is transparent and no personal info is sent. The only info used is regarding the
        system benchmarked and the results.
    </li>
</ul>
